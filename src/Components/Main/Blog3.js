            <h4>By Charles Perry | 4.6.2018</h4>
                <p>
                Father, thank you for making me righteous and accepted through the blood of Jesus. 
                Because of that, I am blessed and highly favored by you. I am the object of your affection. 
                Your favor surrounds me as a shield, and the first thing that people come into contact with 
                is my favor shield. Thank you, that I have favor with you and man today. All day long, people 
                go out of their way to bless me, and to help me. I have favor with everyone that I deal with today. 
                Doors that were once closed are now opened for me. I receive preferential treatment and I have special 
                privileges. I am godâ€™s favored child. No good thing will he withhold from me.<br/>
                In Jesus name, Amen.</p>
