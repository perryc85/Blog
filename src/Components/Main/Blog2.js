            <h4>By Charles Perry | 4.6.2018</h4>
                <p>I'd be lying if I said turning up wasn't a part of the plan this year.
                Those closest to me know, I work hard, but party harder!
                And, do I ever have a long list to accomplish this year. 
                So, Let;s turn up yo! No party poopers here."Why talk about it, 
                when you can be about it?" Another thing to note, most folks can't 
                with me...In other words, I'm crazy, but, in a good way.
                </p>
