            <h4>By Charles Perry | 4.6.2018</h4>
            <p>2016 was my warmup. 2017 was the practice round. 
            Now, It's game time. Yes, my time to shine and grind.
            I vow 2018 to be the year of new ventures, chapters, 
            and opportunities. So look out, here I come world. 
            Are you ready? I am.</p>
